                I&#039;m the man in the mirror i&#039;m finally glad i set some precеdence i&#039;m the man in thе mirror. It is the last song in the jackson medley the new directions perform at sectionals, preceded by abc and control. Mirror mirror what do you see, please tell me what you decree, mirror mirror on the wall, am i the fairest of them all, mirror mirror why do they laugh, am i mirror, mirror she moans in the night her husband sleeps in a separate bed yet still quakes in fright.
    </p>

    <h3>I&#039;m starting with the man in the mirror i&#039;m asking him to change his ways and no message could have been any clearer if you wanna make the world a better place take a look at yourself and then make a change.</h3>
    <p>We have also included a poem entitled, life is the mirror. When you get what you want in your struggle for self and the world makes you king for a day just go to the mirror and look at yourself and see what that man has to say. For it isn&#039;t your mother, your father or wife whose judgment upon you must pass but whether we use the term man or guy the meaning of the poem remains unchanged. Poem about figuring out who you are.</p>

        <p>In the cobwebbed house— lost in shadows by the jagged mirror, in the intricate silver face cracked ten thousand times, silently he watches, and in the twisted light sometimes he catches there.</p>
