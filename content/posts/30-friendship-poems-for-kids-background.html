                True friend a friend is like a star that twinkles and glows or maybe like the ocean that gently flows a friend is like gold that you should treasure. These friends pick up phones like they just spoke yesterday, regardless of how long it has been or how far away they live, and they don&#039;t hold grudges. Share these poems with your friends.
    </p>

    <h3>So many gentle friends are near whom one can scarcely see, a child should never feel a fear, wherever he may be.</h3>
    <p>Over the last year i have put up over 36 over 100 poems for kids written just for woo! I am extremely proud of the quality, they are serious, funny, silly, educational, moving, and easy to use in the classroom. But the love of real true friends. Have you told your kids i love you?</p>
