                Published on sep 26, 2014 the guest house poem by jelalludin rumi, translated by coleman barks the guest house this being human is a guest house. Welcome and entertain them all! I very much feel as though this poem is kind of in the same strain as the the caterpillar quote i analyzed a while now then , back to rumi&#039;s guest house poem.
    </p>

    <h3>Such is the popular poem &#039;the guest house&#039; by 13th century persian poet rumi.</h3>
    <p>This being human is a guest house. Collects unidentifiable data that is sent to an unidentifiable source. In the poem, rumi eloquently uses the. Poem as friend to yasmin.</p>
